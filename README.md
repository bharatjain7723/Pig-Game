# Pig-Game
Pig game is a 2 player dice game where each player has to roll a dice until one of theirs score sum  reaches the desired target.

## Rules of the game: 
- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.
- The players can set the 'FINAL SCORE' which can be changed at any point by either of the players if the game is still going on.
- In each turn, a player rolls a pair of dice as many times as he whishes. Each result(the sum of dices) get added to his ROUND score.
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1(on any dice) or two sixes, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn.
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn.
- The first player to reach the FINAL SCORE on GLOBAL score wins the game.
